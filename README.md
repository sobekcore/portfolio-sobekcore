  Sobek's Developer Portfolio
</h2>

This portfolio is a showcase of my skills and known technologies, as well as brief description about me and projects that i've made. It's made with Next.js, Sass and Gulp. Modern, simple and clear. Hopefully somewhat eye-pleasing :wink:

## How it's working?

The site's core is Next.js and Sass, Next is firstly build and then exported into static files. Sass is complied into one chonky optimized .css file. Then most of the tasks are automated with Gulp, such as committing to GitHub, creating development enviroments etc.
