This project is a web recration of Central Market from the game <BaseLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Desert_Online">Black Desert Online</BaseLink>.

Originally the UI was made with a C++ graphics engine and used internal game API, recration however is made in a techstack of <BaseLink href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</BaseLink> + <BaseLink href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</BaseLink> for the UI and <BaseLink href="https://nestjs.com">Nest.js</BaseLink> for the API.

Color palette is mainly dark gray and brown colors with some exceptions for the most important UI elements. These colors attempt to mimic the color scheme used in the game.
