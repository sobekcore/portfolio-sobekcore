This project is all about a water distribution system with IoT Device and Web Application UI.

The system is meant to be used on all sort of devices, such as phones, tablets, embedded devices screens and more. Responsive design provides the same experience on all platforms.

<BaseImage

  alt="Water Kiosk application preview in portrait orientation."
  aspectRatio="15 / 19"
/>

The application allows user to customize final product to their wantings. Plenty selection steps with clear visual guidance throughout entire decision process.

/>

In the future it will be possible to dispense water from IoT device and its water providing system. For now â€“ only the application UI made it live.

Designs used in this project are very heavily inspired by designs from <BaseLink href="http://charliewaite.me">Charlie Waite</BaseLink> for <BaseLink href="https://www.dropwater.co">Dropwater</BaseLink> and their excellent product.
