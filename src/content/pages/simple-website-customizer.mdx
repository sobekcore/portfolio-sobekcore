This project is a Chrome Web Store extension designed to tailor websites experience to your needs.

The widget allows users to toggle between various different settings that make some changes in the UI. Enlarge and shrink - change colors - move and hide elements, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

<ColorSchemeToggle client:visible>
  <BaseImage
    slot="light"
    src="/projects/simple-website-customizer/thumbnail-light.png"
    alt="Simple Website Customizer extension preview in light mode."
    caption="It can be opened at the top right-hand side of a browser window."
    aspectRatio="16 / 10"
  />
  <BaseImage
    slot="dark"
    src="/projects/simple-website-customizer/thumbnail-dark.png"
    alt="Simple Website Customizer extension preview in dark mode."
    caption="It can be opened at the top right-hand side of a browser window."
    aspectRatio="16 / 10"
  />
</ColorSchemeToggle>

The widget follows best practises for building small, embeddable UIs to create a consistent visual identity. This creates an experience like it would be browser built-in settings instead of an extension.

Widget also allows for adding custom settings to truly make it your own. There is a creator for them with great UX, which means it is really easy to create even advanced settings.
