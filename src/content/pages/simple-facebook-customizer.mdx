This project is a Chrome Web Store extension designed to tailor Facebook experience to your needs.

The widget allows users to toggle between various different settings that make some changes in the UI, for example it can hide navigation bars, message windows, content sections, adds and more.

<ColorSchemeToggle client:visible>
  <BaseImage
    slot="light"
    src="/projects/simple-facebook-customizer/thumbnail-light.png"
    caption="It can be opened at the top right-hand side of a browser window."
    aspectRatio="16 / 10"
  />
  <BaseImage
    slot="dark"
    src="/projects/simple-facebook-customizer/thumbnail-dark.png"
    caption="It can be opened at the top right-hand side of a browser window."
    aspectRatio="16 / 10"
  />
</ColorSchemeToggle>

The widget follows <BaseLink href="https://about.meta.com/brand/resources/facebookapp/guidelines">Facebook Brand Guidelines</BaseLink> to create a visual identity that is the same as original Facebook application. This creates an experience like it would be Facebook built-in settings instead of an extension.

Widget also allows for adding custom settings to truly make it your own. There is a creator for them with great UX, which means it is really easy to create even advanced settings.
