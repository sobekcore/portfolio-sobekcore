        Greetings fellow traveler. Thanks for visiting my portfolio website. <br />
        You probably came here for information about me so... <br />
        I'm a 20 yo male human being from Poland. Programming and designing is <br />
        one of my biggest passions, and things that i'm the most committed to. <br />
        I try to make things as good as i possibly can. <br />
      </p>
    </>
